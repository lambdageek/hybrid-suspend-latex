\section{Async suspend}

Traditionally Mono used an asynchronous suspend mechanism.  With async suspend
the suspend victim participates passively.

\subsection{With POSIX signals}

\paragraph{Suspending} To suspend we switch the victim thread to
\StateAsyncSuspendRequested{} and then send it the suspend signal and add it to the pending operations wait set.
If there are multiple victims we do this for all of them and then wait for
notification that the pending operations completed.

The victim's signal handler switches the state to \StateAsyncSuspended{} and
notifies the initiator and then calls \texttt{sigsuspend()} to wait until it is
sent a resume signal.

\paragraph{Resuming} To resume, the suspend sends the resume signal to the
victim and waits for pending operations.  The signal breaks the victim out of \texttt{sigsuspend()}.
The victim then switches the thread to \StateRunning{} and notifies the initiator.

\subsection{With native suspend}

On Darwin and on Windows, we can use the operating system thread suspend calls to asynchronously suspend threads.
In this case all transitions are preformed by the initiator.

\paragraph{Suspending} The initiator switches the victim to
\StateAsyncSuspendRequested{} and then calls the OS-specific suspend syscall on
the victim thread.  After checking that the victim suspended
successfully\footnote{There may be OS-specific reasons why a victim may not be
  suspendable.}, the suspend initiator switches the victim to
\StateAsyncSuspended{} \emph{without} adding it to the pending wait operation.
Then the suspend initiator waits for pending ops (of which there should be
none).

      \node (asr) at (rt2) {} ;
      \node [anchor = west] at (asrpre) {\tiny \StateRunning {} } ;
      \node [anchor = west] at (asr) {\tiny \StateAsyncSuspendRequested {} } ;

      \mess[1]{initiator}{native-suspend-syscall}{victim} ;

      \begin{messcall}{initiator}{async-suspended}{state}
      \end{messcall}
      \node (asuspre) at (ct2) {} ;
      \node (asus) at (rt2) {} ;
      \node [anchor = west] at (asuspre) {\tiny \StateAsyncSuspendRequested {} } ;
      \node [anchor = west] at (asus) {\tiny \StateAsyncSuspended {} } ;
    \end{call}
    \begin{call}{initiator}{wait-for-pending-ops}{initiator}{}
    \end{call}
  \end{sequencediagram}
  \caption{Native async suspend}
  \label{fig:native-async-susp}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Resuming} Similar to native suspend, the initiator switches the
thread from \StateAsyncSuspended{} to \StateRunning and then uses the
OS-specific resume syscall.  Nothing is added to the pending operations set, so
the wait for pending operations after the resume returns without waiting.  We
omit the figure for this case.

\section{Blocking transitions}

So far, we have 5 possible states for a thread:

\begin{compactenum}
\item Starting
\item \StateRunning {}
\item \StateAsyncSuspendRequested {}
\item \StateAsyncSuspended {}
\item Detached
\end{compactenum}

The starting and detached states indicate threads that should be ignored by the
suspend machinery because they haven't started running yet, or because they are
no longer allowed to run any code.

In \StateAsyncSuspended {} the victim thread is not executing any code.  In the
other two states, the thread is running in a \emph{GC Unsafe} thread state.

\paragraph{GC Unsafe thread state} A GC Unsafe thread may read and write
managed memory at any time.  It may hold references to managed objects in
registers.

While any victim threads are in a GC Unsafe state, we cannot run the garbage collector.

With async suspend the suspend initiator preempts all victim threads and (in an
OS-specific manner) ensures that all references to managed objects are made
visible to the GC.

Classically with fully-preemptive suspend, Mono assumed that all mutator
threads were always in a GC Unsafe state while they were running.

\paragraph{GC Safe thread state} A GC Safe thread does not read or write any
managed memory and does not hold references to managed objects in registers.

An example of a thread that is potentially in a GC Safe state is a thread that
calls a blocking system call (without passing any managed memory reference to
the syscall).  Such a thread does not interfere with the GC until it returns.
A suspend initiator is thus free to ignore threads while they're in a GC Safe
state.

We add the following 3 blocking states:
\begin{compactenum}
\item \StateBlocking {}
\item \StateBlockingSuspendRequested {}
\item \StateBlockingSelfSuspended {}
\end{compactenum}

Additionally, there is one more suspend state for a GC Unsafe thread: \StateSelfSuspended.

The transitions from running states to blocking states are always performed by the victim thread itself.

There are three kinds of transitions between running and blocking states and vice versa.

\paragraph{Do Blocking} This is a transition from \StateRunning{} to \StateBlocking{].
If the victim is \StateAsyncSuspendRequested{}, the transition is ignored, the
victim must poll and self-suspend and then try again after resuming.

\paragraph{Done Blocking}
This is a transition from \StateBlocking{} to \StateRunning{}.
If the victim is in \StateBlockingSuspendRequested{}, the transition is
disallowed and the victim must poll and self-suspend.


\paragraph{Abort Blocking} This is a transition from \StateBlocking{} to
\StateRunning{}.  As with Done Blocking, the thread may be in
\StateBlockingSuspendRequested{} and if so it must poll and self-suspend.
Additionally, the thread may be in \StateRunning{} (in which case the abort is
ignored), or \StateAsyncSuspendRequested{} (in which case the thread must poll
and self-suspend and then ignore the abort request).  Abort Blocking is used to
ensure that a thread is in a running state when it is unknown what its current
state it.  (By contrast, a Done Blocking transition from a blocking state is a
programmer error.)  Abort Blocking is most commonly used by Mono runtime APIs
that may be called either by the runtime itself or by embedders.
